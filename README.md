# Generating Functions

### Some experiments to learn more about generating functions

Wrote a really simple polynomial divider in the form of a python generator (guess that's a pun) to see any number of terms given an ordinary generating function which is just a ratio of two polynomials

Just run:

    python test_poly_div.py

In a shell to see some examples
